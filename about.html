        <h2>Freelance Virtual Assistant and Aspiring Full Stack Engineer</h2>
    </p>
    <p>Hi Everyone, my name is Mojisola Oke (ALT/SOE/024/1289), a second-time student of AltSchool Africa in the Backend Engineering track</p>
    <p>I said second-time because I first joined AltSchool with the Tinyuka cohort but lfe happened and I dropped off along the way
    <p>Here I am again, better prepared to face the next one year with a new cohort and hoping for the best.</p>
        I'm a full-time Virtual Assistant, part time Ideator and right now, an aspiring Full Stack Engineer currently in the Backend Engineering program but with plans to 
        pick back up my Frontend Engineering program from Tinyuka if possible.
    </p>

    <p>The goal remains the same though --- To gain the technical skills I need to build the ideas that I have.
      <br>
      To move from being an ideator to a builder of solutions that can change the world.
    </p>
